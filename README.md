# Arcade-Jumper
This arcade jumping stimulation was the midterm project built in 39 hours for SJSU CS 134 Game Design Programming class

It is an individual assignment to help student understand how to build gravity, particle collisions and using spriting sheet for character animation for a 2D game

The whole game was built from scratch using C++ and Openframework

# Controls
**Left/Right Arrow Keys** move the character left and right

**Up Arrow Key** make the character jump

Note: Character can only jump to the upper level. Wasn't enought time to implement collision detection for the lower level. Pending further updare

Enjoy the game!
